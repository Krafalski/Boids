# Flocking

I was really inspired by the beautiful demonstration built by Drew Cutchins in his blog post for [Flocking](https://www.blog.drewcutchins.com/blog/2018-8-16-flocking)

I'm totally new to using canvas and the thing that was preventing me from trying it out before was that I didn't find any tutorials all that interesting to build and explore.

Also, as I've been learning to code, I've shied away from things that have been 'Mathy', but this blog post motivated me to push past that and learn some things I was sort of avoiding.
